You Only Look Once (YOLO) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. It is one of the fastest object detection algorithms, capable of processing up to 45 frames per second. YOLO is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that divides an image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and probabilities for each grid cell. It is widely used in various applications, such as autonomous driving, surveillance, and robotics.
